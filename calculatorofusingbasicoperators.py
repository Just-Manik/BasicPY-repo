#Q1 simply create a calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations
print(2+3)  # Output: 5
print(2-3)  # Output: -1    
print(2*3)  # Output: 6
print(2/3)  # Output: 0.6666666666666666 (float division)
print(2//3)  # Output: 0 (floor division)
print(21%3)  # Output: 0 (modulus, remainder of division)
print(2**3)  # Output: 8 (exponentiation, 2 raised to the power of 3)

print("ENter first number")
a = int(input())
print("Enter second number")
b = int(input())
print("Addition:", a + b)  # Output: Sum of a and b
print("Subtraction:", a - b)  # Output: Difference of a and b       
print("Multiplication:", a * b)  # Output: Product of a and b
print("Division:", a / b)  # Output: Quotient of a and b
print("Floor Division:", a // b)  # Output: Floor division of a by b
print("Modulus:", a % b)  # Output: Remainder of a divided by b
print("Exponentiation:", a ** b)  # Output: a raised to the power of b
